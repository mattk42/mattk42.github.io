# The Problem

Recently I was faced with an issue where a VIP customer on a legacy application was causing horribly inefficient queries. Trying to work with the customer to change their use case was leading us nowhere, and there is no current development effort on this application so fixing the code was not an option. These queries were causing slowness and were putting that application in very high danger of an outage. What to do?

# The Solution

We tried various things that all helped a little, adding some more hardware, a bit of tuning specific to that customer, cleaning up old data. But none of that was enough, it was time to try something a bit more out of the ordinary. We knew this whole time that there was one specific query that was causing full table scans and filesorts, and this query could easily be fixed by removing a forced index that the application was adding. What we didnâ€™t know is that there was something we could do about it without needing a code change, enter MySQL Proxy.

MySQL Proxy is a highly flexible proxy that sits inbetween the client and the database and can monitor or manipulate traffic as it passes through. This sounds like the perfect solution, except that it is alpha software and has been since 2007.

But we were running out of options, so we took a bit of a risk and decided to implement MySQL Proxy inbetween our application and the database to rewrite specific queries. And it has been working really well! It handles around 5 million queries a day, modifying only .1% of them.

# Implementation

Since MySQL proxy is not meant for production just yet, we wanted to make sure we could handle a situation where it crashed. So we decided to put HAProxy infront of MySQL proxy, configured to pass traffic through straight to the database if the proxy is down. This is what the solution looks like:

# HAProxy Configuration 
(Note: we are using a xinetd script provided by Unai Rodriguez for healthchecks on the proxy, information on that can be found here):

# MySQL Proxy Configuration
MySQL Proxy uses a single configuration file that specifies what Lua based scripts to use. These scripts are where you define what you want MySQL Proxy to accomplish. In my case, I used two scripts. One script for configuring how to modify queries on the fly, and the other defines a management console which allows me to view some stats about how the proxy is functioning. Both of those scripts were simple modifications of the example scripts found here.

The main configuration file is pretty straight forward, just pointing at the Lua scripts that do the real work.

~~~
[mysql-proxy]
daemon = true
user = root

pid-file = /var/run/mysql-proxy.pid
log-file = /var/log/mysql-proxy.log
log-level = info

proxy-lua-script=/etc/mysql-proxy/proxy.lua
proxy-address = 10.10.106.16:3307
proxy-backend-addresses = 10.10.106.16:3306

admin-username = <admin user>
admin-address = 127.0.0.1:4404

Here is our proxy.lua script

And the admin.lua script, which has very slight modifications to support the new idx_removal counter.

we use a simple string-match to split commands are word-boundaries

mysql> show querycounter

is split into
command = "show"
option  = "querycounter"

spaces are ignored, the case has to be as is.

mysql> show myerror

returns a error-packet

Once you have these configs and scripts in place and have started all of the services (HAProxy, MySQL, and MySQL Proxy), you should be able to start running some queries through it and see them modified before they hit MySQL!

To use the admin console, you can simply connect to the admin port (4404 in this example) using a MySQL client . Here are a couple of examples of using the admin console.

~~~
[mjknox@database ~]# mysql -u<username> -p<password> -h127.0.0.1 -P4404 -e "show querycounter;";
+---------------+
| query_counter |
+---------------+
|      60819702 |
+---------------+
~~~
~~~
[mjknox@database ~]# mysql -u<username> -p<password> -h127.0.0.1 -P4404 -e "show idxremovalcounter;"
+---------------------+
| idx_removal_counter |
+---------------------+
|               66892 |
+---------------------+
~~~

Getting this in place in our environment has saved us many headaches, and our database servers have been much happier because of it. If you are in a similar situation as I was, MySQL Proxy may just be the answer you are looking for.
